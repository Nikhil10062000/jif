      In 2019, React.js was the most loved web framework by developers worldwide - coming in at a very close 2nd position in 2020 according to the most recent survey done by StackOverflow. Until now, we found 242,230 React.js questions and 134,302 npm packages, meaning that the future of React.js in 2020 is brighter than the sun.

Why do we love it? Because it helps us create the most engaging web apps efficiently and fast with minimal coding. Since its release back in 2013, the goal of React.js was to provide outstanding rendering performance, considering its core strength is on individual components. Although it won the “battle” against Vue.js in 2019, things are changing fast in the software development realm; ASP.NET Core occupies the pole position with 70.7%, followed by React.js with 68,9%.

We've taken the relevant data and we've created this 2020 React.js infographic. More details and explanations below.

React.js is 2nd Most Loved web framework in 2020
In Stack Overflow’s 2020 Developer Survey, out of 57.378 responses, 68,9% respondents expressed interest to continue working with React.js. For the 3rd year in a row, React.js covers the top position in the Most Wanted category with 22.4% of developers who’ve never worked with it, expressing interest in picking it up.

From a developer’s perspective, programming is art. They need to love the different tools they use, not just use them for the sake of programming. For us, at Thinslices, it’s a lot easier to work with tools that bring joy and pleasure. Here’s what one of our most experienced senior software developers has to say on that note:

For me, as a software developer, building amazing, robust products is a top priority. I fell in love with React.js because it gives me a sense of joy and fulfilment when reusing components. By adhering to this rule “one function, one component”, I can stay focused on improving the reusability of components. Rather than develop a new component to suit a function, I can work with an existing component that I already have for a function. This way, I don’t have to start all over again and I can maintain consistency when working on one or more projects.
